<h1 id="creating-the-sending-profile">Creating the Sending Profile</h1>
<p>Creating a sending profile is easy for this campaign. Navigate to the
“Sending Profiles” page and click “New Profile”.</p>
<p>For my campaign, I’ll be sending emails from Boyd Jenius, the system
administrator. I’ll use his name and email address in the “From”
field.</p>
<p>I have my Morning Catch VM listening for inbound email on
<code>192.168.56.101:25</code> so I will use that for my “Host”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember: <strong>Always</strong> specify the port number when
configuring a sending profile! Use the host:port format when specifying
the Host.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should wind up with something that looks like this:</p>

<p>If you want, you can send a test email to another recipient on the
<code>morningcatch.ph</code> domain to ensure emails are relayed
correctly.</p>
<p>After the settings are specified, click “Save Profile”.</p>
