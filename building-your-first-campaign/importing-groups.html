<h1 id="importing-groups">Importing Groups</h1>
<p>The first thing we need to do before we can launch a campaign is to
figure out who to target. There are a ton of ways to gather/generate
email addresses for potential targets. You can either harvest email
addresses from public information using OSINT if you are aiming to
simulate a realistic scenario.</p>
<p>Now that we have our list of users, let’s import them into
gophish.</p>
<p>To add a group, navigate to the “Users &amp; Groups” page and click
“New Group”:</p>

<p>Since we are performing phishing simulation for Morning Catch, we can
call our group “Morning Catch Employees”.</p>
<p>Now we have to add the members. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add each member’s details one at a time using the form inputs</li>
<li>Bulk import the group from a CSV file</li>
</ul>
<p>To save time (and typing!) let’s go with the CSV option.</p>
<h2 id="importing-from-csv">Importing from CSV</h2>
<p>The CSV format gophish expects has the following header values:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Position</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the CSV for Morning Catch would look like the following:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>First Name,Last Name,Position,Email
Richard,Bourne,CEO,rbourne@morningcatch.ph
Boyd,Jenius,Systems Administrator,bjenius@morningcatch.ph
Haiti,Moreo,Sales &amp; Marketing,hmoreo@morningcatch.ph</code></pre>
<p>After uploading this CSV using the “Bulk Import Users” button, we see
that our members were added automatically:</p>

</figure>
<p>After clicking “Save changes”, we see a confirmation message that our
group was created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: If you don’t see the group show up right away, refresh the page
and it should appear in the table.</p>
