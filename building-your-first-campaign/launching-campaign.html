<p>Now that we have all the pieces setup, we can launch the
campaign!</p>
<p>To create a new campaign, navigate to the Campaigns page and click
the “New Campaign” button.</p>
<p>Most of the settings should be self-explanatory. The only thing to
look out for is the <code>URL</code> field. Since the IP address of our
Gophish server is <code>192.168.1.1</code>, that’s what we’ll use:</p>

<p>Once all the settings filled, click “Launch Campaign” to start
sending the emails!</p>
<h2 id="viewing-the-results">Viewing the Results</h2>
<p>After launching the campaign, you will be automatically redirected to
the campaign results page. This will give you a realtime view as emails
are sent, opened, and links are clicked.</p>
