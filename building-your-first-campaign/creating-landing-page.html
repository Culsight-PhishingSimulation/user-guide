<p>The Morning Catch corporation has a webmail portal that we will clone
for our landing page.</p>
<p>Start by navigating to the “Landing Pages” page and clicking the “New
Page” button.</p>
<p>To import a site by URL, click the “Import Site” button. The webmail
portal is located at <code>/mail/</code>, so I will use
<code>http://192.168.56.101/mail/</code> as my import URL.</p>

the import, you’ll see the HTML populated into the editor. Clicking the
“Source” button shows a preview of the page.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ll capture submitted data and passwords by checking both
options, and we’ll redirect users to the webmail portal after they
submit credentials.</p>
<p>Finally, click “Save Page” to save the landing page.</p>
