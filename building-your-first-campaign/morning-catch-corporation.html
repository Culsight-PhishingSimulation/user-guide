<p>For this documentation, we will step through the process of setting
up users, templates, and a full campaign from scratch for a fake company
called Morning Catch. In this case, we are assuming the role of a
security administrator of Morning Catch and have been given the
authorization to perform this training.</p>
<p>As a note, this fake company is based on a great VM used specifically
for testing phishing frameworks that you can download <a

if youâ€™re interested.</p>
<p>The fake company will consist of 3 users: Richard Bourne, Boyd
Jenius, and Haiti Moreo.</p>
