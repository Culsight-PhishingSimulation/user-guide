                Unable to Reach Admin Dashboard

            <p>
                Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve just loaded up Culsight - Phishing Simulation, are trying to reach the admin
                dashboard, and encounter this error in your logs:
            </p>
            <pre
                class="text"><code>2018/11/15 21:42:22 http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:51419: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake</code></pre>
            <p>
                This means that you browsed to
                <code>http://admin_server</code> instead of
                <code>https://admin_server</code> (note the use of HTTPS).

            <h2 id="how-to-bypass-spam-filters">How to Bypass Spam Filters</h2>
            <p>
                There is no fool proof way to bypass spam filters -
                <strong>this is a good thing!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that might help increase deliverability is to set up your
                email infrastructure correctly to support modern email authentication
                protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. You can find more information
                about this
                <a href="https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/take-employees-phishing/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, for tests that aim to measure how users respond to phishing
                simulations, it‚Äôs recommend to temporarily whitelist the IP address of
                the server running Culsight - Phishing Simulation.
            </p>
            <h2 id="events-arent-showing-up-on-the-dashboard">
                Events Aren‚Äôt Showing Up on the Dashboard
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you are seeing emails being sent successfully, but aren‚Äôt seeing
                events show up on the dashboard, it likely means there is a
                configuration error somewhere. You can follow these tips to help track
                it down.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Check the Email Template</strong></p>
            <p>
                You want to make sure you‚Äôre using the <code>{{.URL}}</code> template
                tag when creating links in your emails. Then, when you launch a
                campaign, Culsight - Phishing Simulation will fill this in with whatever you use as the ‚ÄúURL‚Äù
                field when creating the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good way to see if this is working correctly is to send a test email
                to yourself when building a campaign and looking at the link. It
                should be the URL you used when creating the campaign with a unique
                <code>rid</code> parameter. So, it should look like this:
                <code>http://your_url/?rid=XXXXX</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
                <strong>Tip</strong>: Don‚Äôt try to put your
                Culsight - Phishing Simulation URL directly into a template. It‚Äôs very important to use the
                <code>{{.URL}}</code> template tag, since that‚Äôs how Culsight - Phishing Simulation knows to
                generate the unique URL for each recipient.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Check the Campaign URL</strong></p>
            <p>
                If the links in the email look good and you still don‚Äôt see events
                showing up, then the next step is to make sure the URL you‚Äôre using
                when building a campaign is correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating a campaign, the URL field
                <strong>must point to the server running Culsight - Phishing Simulation and must be reachable by
                    the person opening the emails.</strong>
                This can either be the external IP address of the server, or a domain
                name that has a DNS A record pointing to the server‚Äôs IP address.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Remember that the
                campaign URL must be reachable by the recipients clicking the links.
                If they can‚Äôt reach the Culsight - Phishing Simulation server, Culsight - Phishing Simulation can‚Äôt record those
                events.
            </p>
            <p>
                To test this, you can manually browse to the URL you‚Äôre expecting to
                use in your campaign. Without any <code>rid</code> parameters
                provided, you should see a basic
                <code>404 page not found</code> error. You should also see a log
                appear in your Culsight - Phishing Simulation terminal.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Remember that if your
                Culsight - Phishing Simulation <code>phish_server</code> configuration is set to use HTTPS
                that you need to include the URL in your campaign as
                <code>https://your_url</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once manually browsing to your URL works, you can try to send a test
                email to yourself when building a campaign. If it works, you should
                see your landing page being returned. This means that the URL will
                likely work when used in a campaign, assuming it is reachable by all
                recipients.

            <h2 id="submitted-form-data-isnt-being-captured">
                Submitted Form Data Isn‚Äôt Being Captured
            </h2>
            <p>
                To capture data submitted through a landing page, you need to create
                an HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element on your landing page that
                has a few specific properties:
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a minimal example <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element which
                captures data:
            </p>
            <pre class="markup"><code>&lt;form action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input name=&quot;username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;username&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input name=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; placeholder=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>There are a few things to note about this form:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The action is <code>""</code> so that form submissions are directed
                    to your phishing page and, therefore, to your Culsight - Phishing Simulation server
                </li>
                <li>The form submission method is <code>POST</code></li>
                <li>
                    Each input which you expect to see in Culsight - Phishing Simulation has a
                    <code>name</code> attribute
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these should be checked when troubleshooting HTML forms that
                don‚Äôt appear to be sending data correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you still aren‚Äôt seeing your form submitted correctly, you may need
                to review and remove any Javascript on the page interfering with the
                form submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, ensure that when saving the landing page that you have both
                the ‚ÄúCapture Submitted Data‚Äù and ‚ÄúCapture Passwords‚Äù (if appropriate)
                options checked. Otherwise, Culsight - Phishing Simulation will remove the
                <code>name</code> attributes from your inputs so they aren‚Äôt submitted
                with the form.
