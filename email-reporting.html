            <h1 id="email-reporting">Email Reporting</h1>
            <p>Culsight - Phishing Simulation supports the ability for users to report the simulated
                phishing emails they receive. This is to encourage users to report
                suspicious to their administrators, potentially catching malicious
                emails earlier.</p>
            <p>Right now, we only support this reporting feature on the
                <strong>server side</strong> of things. While we don‚Äôt yet have actual
                email extensions and add ons that can be used to facilitate this
                reporting, as of v0.9.0 we do support email reporting via IMAP.
            </p>
            <h2 id="the-importance-of-email-reporting">The Importance of Email
                Reporting</h2>
            <p>When running phishing simulations, we often focus solely on how many
                users clicked the links and submitted their credentials to the spoofed
                page. However, I would argue that there‚Äôs just as much if not more value
                in focusing on who reported the emails to their administrator.</p>
            <p>Consider a simple scenario where we send out 100 simulated phishing
                emails. Let‚Äôs look through two possible outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outcome 1</strong> - In this outcome, only 1 user clicks the
                    link and submits credentials. That‚Äôs great! However, no one reports the
                    email. In this case, as an administrator our users were targeted by
                    phishing and an attacker has a valid set of credentials, yet we don‚Äôt
                    know anything has happened.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome 2</strong> - In this outcome, 50 users click the
                    link and only 1 user reports it. In this case sure, more users clicked
                    the link, but as an administrator we now know that a phishing campaign
                    is in progress and we can start the incident response process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Reporting suspicious emails can help prevent the impact of a phishing
                campaign. It‚Äôs recommended to build a culture that <strong>rewards the
                    users who report emails</strong>. Even something small like an email to
                that employee and their manager thanking them for their vigilance can go
                a long ways. This gives positive feedback that will encourage users to
                report more emails in the future.</p>
            <h2 id="reporting-via-imap">Reporting via IMAP</h2>
            <p>A common (and good!) practice for organizations is to create an email
                address such as security@example.com and encourage employees to forward
                any suspicious emails. This is a great way to work towards building a
                collaborative relationship between the employee and security team.</p>
            <p>As of v0.9.0, Culsight - Phishing Simulation has the ability to check a configured mailbox
                via IMAP for campaign emails that have been reported. Once a campaign
                email is found, that result is updated to show that the user reported
                the email.</p>
            <p>Each Culsight - Phishing Simulation user has the ability to configure their own IMAP
                settings. These settings are found under ‚ÄúAccount Settings &gt;
                Reporting Settings‚Äù.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/IMAP.png" width="900px"
                    alt="IMAP Configuration Settings" />
                <figcaption aria-hidden="true">IMAP Configuration Settings</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The most common settings you‚Äôll need are the IMAP hostname, port,
                username, and password. It‚Äôs commonly the case that you‚Äôll want to
                enable TLS but this is something you should confirm with your email
                provider.</p>
            <h3 id="advanced-settings">Advanced Settings</h3>
            <p>There is also a number of Advanced Settings that allow you to
                configure which folder campaign emails will be listed in or how often
                Culsight - Phishing Simulation should poll for new results. Additionally, you can restrict it
                to only consider emails that have been reported from an address with
                your organizations domain name. Finally, Culsight - Phishing Simulation can optionally delete
                campaign emails after they have been reported.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/AdvancedIMAP.png" width="900px" alt="Advanced IMAP Settings" />
                <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Advanced IMAP Settings</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After IMAP settings have been configured, you can either save them or
                use the ‚ÄúTest Settings‚Äù button to confirm that Culsight - Phishing Simulation can establish an
                IMAP connection.</p>
            <h2 id="how-reporting-works-in-Culsight">How Reporting Works in
                Culsight - Phishing Simulation</h2>
            <p>Every email sent by Culsight - Phishing Simulation contains a link pointing to the <a href="landing-pages.html">Landing Page</a>
                configured for the campaign.
                This URL looks like this:</p>
            <pre class="text"><code>http://phish_server/?rid=1234567</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>rid</code> parameter specifies which recipient this link
                was generated for. To report an email sent by Culsight - Phishing Simulation, an HTTP request
                needs to be made to:</p>
            <pre class="text"><code>http://phish_server/report?rid=1234567</code></pre>
            <p>Sending this HTTP request is usually handled by a mail client
                extension. As indicated earlier, we‚Äôre still working on getting those
                developed. If you‚Äôre interested in helping make this happen, please <a
